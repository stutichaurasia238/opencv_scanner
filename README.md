My Smart Scanner Project: Real-time Object Detection and Scanning

Welcome to the My Smart Scanner Project! This project provides a real-time object detection and scanning system using OpenCV and Python. The system captures images from a camera, detects objects, and allows users to save the detected objects as PDF files.

Features:

* Real-time object detection using OpenCV
* Capture images from a camera
* Detect objects using contour detection and edge detection
* Draw bounding rectangles around detected objects
* Save detected objects as PDF files

How to Use:

Requirements-
* Python 3.x
* OpenCV 4.x
* PIL (Python Imaging Library)

Running the Project-
* Clone or download the repository.
* Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
* Run the project using python main.py.
* The system will capture images from the default camera and detect objects in real-time.
* Press 's' to save the detected object as a PDF file.

Technical Details-
* The project uses OpenCV to capture images from the camera and detect objects using contour detection and edge detection.
* The detected objects are drawn with bounding rectangles using OpenCV.
* The PIL library is used to save the detected objects as PDF files.
